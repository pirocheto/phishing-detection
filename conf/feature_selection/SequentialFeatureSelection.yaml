# If "auto", the behaviour depends on the tol parameter:
# if tol is not None, then features are selected while the score change does not exceed tol.
# otherwise, half of the features are selected.
# If integer, the parameter is the absolute number of features to select.
# If float between 0 and 1, it is the fraction of features to select.
n_features_to_select: 10

# If the score is not incremented by at least tol between two consecutive feature additions or removals, stop adding or removing.
# tol can be negative when removing features using direction="backward". It can be useful to reduce the number of features at the cost of a small decrease in the score.
# tol is enabled only when n_features_to_select is "auto".
tol: null

# Whether to perform forward selection or backward selection.
direction: forward

# A single str (see The scoring parameter: defining model evaluation rules) or a callable (see Defining your scoring strategy from metric functions) to evaluate the predictions on the test set.
# NOTE that when using a custom scorer, it should return a single value.
# If None, the estimatorâ€™s score method is used.
scoring: null

# Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
# Possible inputs for cv are:
# None, to use the default 5-fold cross validation,
# integer, to specify the number of folds in a (Stratified)KFold,
# CV splitter,
# An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.
cv: null

# Number of jobs to run in parallel.
# When evaluating a new feature to add or remove, the cross-validation procedure is parallel over the folds.
# None means 1 unless in a joblib.parallel_backend context. -1 means using all processors.
